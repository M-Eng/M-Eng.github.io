Since November 2020 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [CVLAB](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) at EPFL, Switzerland. Previously, I did a PhD in Machine Learning while working at Technicolor/Interdigital and Sorbonne University. 
Before starting doctoral studies, I received a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from EPFL.  
On this site you will find my research projects with their papers, codes, talks and slides whenever available.

In addition to my research activity, I am passionate about music, and on an endless path to improve my guitar skills. I also appreciate the DIY spirit and dabbled in Guitar building, CNC building and machining, 3D printing and other electronic projects.

Currently looking for a postdoctoral position in machine learning. I previously did a PhD in Machine Learning while working at Technicolor/Interdigital and Sorbonne University. 
Before starting doctoral studies, I received a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from EPFL.  
I built this page to regroup my research projects and make them more easily accessible.

In addition to my research activity, I am passionate about music, and on an endless path to improve my guitar skills. I also appreciate the DIY spirit and dabbled in Guitar building, CNC building and machining, 3D printing and other electronics projects.

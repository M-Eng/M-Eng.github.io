Since November 2020, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the [CVLAB](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) at EPFL, Switzerland. Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Machine Learning while working at Technicolor/Interdigital and Sorbonne University. 
Before embarking on my doctoral studies, I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from EPFL.  
On this site, you will find my research projects along with their associated papers, code repositories, talks, and slides, whenever available.

Beyond my research activities, I am passionate about music and am on a continuous journey to enhance my guitar skills. I also have a keen interest in DIY projects, having explored areas such as guitar building, CNC machine construction and operation, 3D printing, and various electronic projects. These hands-on experiences complement my academic pursuits and fuel my curiosity for practical applications of technology.
